   <p>Appropriation in art and art history refers to the practice of artists using pre-existing objects or images in their art with little transformation of the original.</p>
   <p>I want to create a photo editor, that can recontexualize found images or images not owned by the users and turn them into their own work.</p>
   <p>By creating this photo editor, I am not participating this practice of appropriation, but it serves the purpose of letting users to rethink about the boundaries of authorship and to what extent we need to manipulate the work in order to claim the “new work” is owned by us.</p>
   <p>For this purpose, I am not making a complex photo editing program, but trying to have the minimum features required to recontextualize a photograph.</p>
